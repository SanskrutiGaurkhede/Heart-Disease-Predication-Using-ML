# Heart-Disease-Predication-Using-ML
This repository hosts an implementation of a heart disease detection algorithm using a dataset. The algorithm aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various medical attributes and historical data. The project is developed to facilitate research, experimentation, and potential integration into healthcare systems for early detection and prevention of heart-related illnesses.
Dataset: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the heart disease detection algorithm. The dataset is properly documented and includes information about each attribute.
